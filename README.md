# Weather API

This program creates a weather dashboard that will run in browser and will dynamically update HTML and CSS. This API will retrieve data from [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) and use the context as it's own. 

## User Story

As a traveler 
I want to look up the weather of multiple cities
So that I can plan if I want to travel there or not

## Functionality
This API will have a search bar to search the cities. When the search button is pressed it will present the current weather conditions for that city as well as the city's 5 day forecast. The current weather condition will include the city name, date, icon that represent weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, wind speed as well as the UV index. The UV index will be color coded to indicate whether the condition are favorable, moderate or severe. The 5 day forecast will only present the date, icon of weather condition, the temeperature as well as the humidity at 3PM of that date. The search history will allow users to check what they search in their last session and delete the previous session before. When clicking on search history it will bring up the condition of that city.
